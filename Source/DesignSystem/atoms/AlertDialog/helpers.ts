export const alertDialogDescription = `Dialogs are windows that appear in front of all content to provide immediate and critical information or 
to ask the user for a decision. Dialogs disable all other functionality until a user engages with it by either confirming,
dismissing, or taking the required action. Dialogs are purposefully interruptive so they should be used sparingly. 

**Styling:** In some cases the description may be enough information for the user to make a decision and a title is not needed.
If a title is required use a clear question or statement with an explanation in the content area. Avoid apologies, 
ambiguity or questions such as "warning!" or "are you sure?". 

**Types of Dialogs:**
- ***Alert dialogs*** are urgent interruptions, requiring acknowledgement or action, that inform the user about a situation. 
Most alerts do not need titles. They summarize a decision in a sentence or two by either asking a question or making a 
statement related to the action buttons.
Alert dialogs must always contain an action item such as "agree", "accept", or "continue" and a dismissive action such as "cancel", 
"disagree" or "deny".`;
